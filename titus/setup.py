### details of dependencies:
# 
# Only tested in Python 2.7, but it ought to work in Python 2.6 (will be tested someday).
# Will not work in Python 3.x without 2to3 conversion (also untested).
# The module is pure-Python, so (for instance) it works in Jython 2.7.
# 
# Avro is required; it is an integral part of PFA (only versions 1.7.6 -- 1.7.7 have been tested).
# PLY is required; it is used to parse PrettyPFA and Inspector commandlines (only version 3.4 has been tested).
# 
# PyYAML is an optional dependency; it is only used by the titus.reader.yamlToAst function (and only version 3.11 has been tested).
# Numpy is an optional dependency; it is only used by the "interp", "la", "stat.test", and "model.reg" PFA libraries, as well as Titus producers (and only version 1.7.1 has been tested).
# pytz is an optional dependency; it is only used by the "time" PFA library (2015.4 is required for adherence to PFA 0.8.1).
# 
# The test suite attempts to import all optional dependencies.
